# Paprika

Paprika is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that allows you to write powerful, server-side plugins in Lua, a language which is far easier to learn and has major benefits over Java.

It wasn't used by the people I'd hoped it'd be and is now being phased out in terms of [blackbox](https://github.com/BlackBoxMC/blackbox) so I can use a lagnuage I like more.
